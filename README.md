For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2017 to better understand:

1. what type of companies do students end up in after their college or professional studies?
2. Is your college major a major factor in the type of company you get placed in?
3. and if you choose to move to tech career after not having a computer degree will you regret it?
